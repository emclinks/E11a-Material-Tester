# E11a-Material-Tester

The exercise is based on [Godot 3 Tutorial: PBR Materials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM5j8x71HcE). It was completed for the class MSCH-G220 Game Technology as our introduction to applying materials and textures to 3D Models within godot to simulate different materials for other projects. 

The following materials have been recreated on simple Godot-themed balls as a method of testing different textures and materials on 3D Models: white plastic, mirror, dark wood, cheese, stones, brick, wool, aluminium, marble, wet sand, rock, ice, toon-style.

Enjoy!
